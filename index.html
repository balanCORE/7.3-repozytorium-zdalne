		<h2>John Lennon - autor</h2>
		<h3>IMAGINE - tytu≈Ç</h3>
		<p>
			Imagine there's no heaven
			It's easy if you try
			No hell below us
			Above us only sky
			Imagine all the people
			Living for today
			
			Imagine there's no countries
			It isn't hard to do
			Nothing to kill or die for
			And no religion too
			Imagine all the people
			Living life in peace

			You may say I'm a dreamer
			But I'm not the only one
			I hope someday you'll join us
			And the world will be as one
